# Routing-algorithm-for-NOC 
The integration of over one hundred IP cores on a single chip has made the modern System of Chips (SoC) more complex. To separate communication and computing, the silicon industries are promoting the notion of ”Network on Chip.” For Network-on-Chip, Router is the fundamental component. The goal is to create and deploy an adaptable Network-on-Chip router that includes multiple architectural stages, supports virtual channels, and is thoroughly verified using testbenches.The aim is to provide and evaluate adaptive routing algorithm, which must be able dynamically modify its routing decisions in response to changes in network traffic and topology i.e., effective, scalable, and can accommodate a large number of processing parts while also reducing latency and energy.A network-on-chip (NoC) that permits effective communication between the various processor units (PEs) in the MPSoC is the explicit goal of the hardware implementation of the RISC-V based NoC-MPSoC architecture with an adaptive routing algorithm. 
The primary objective is to design, develop, and deploy an adaptable Network-on-Chip router capable of efficiently managing communication between multiple processing elements within an MPSoC. This router will include multiple architectural stages and support features such as virtual channels to enhance communication efficiency.
The motivation behind this endeavor is to overcome the limitations of traditional bus-based communication architectures in MPSoCs. By adopting a NoC approach, the goal is to improve scalability, reduce latency, and conserve energy by separating communication and computing functionalities. This separation allows for more flexible and efficient communication paths, leading to improved overall system performance.
